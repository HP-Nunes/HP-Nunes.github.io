I"Æ<p>ArchiTech uses publicly available data to run zoning analysis scenarios on a property in San Francisco. Working in a team of five, my role was to gather, edit, and clean GIS data (using Python Pandas, and using some SQL in QGIS). I learned how to use MapBoxâ€™s API to render 3D visualization of a target property model.
