Over the course of my internship at National Geographic's Education Division, I created a set of maps and written content on staple food crops using datasets from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The map layers can be accessed and visualized directly on the [MapMaker Interactive](https://mapmaker.nationalgeographic.org/#/){:target="_blank"}.
