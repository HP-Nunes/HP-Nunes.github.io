[Currently a work in progress]. This project is a major data portfolio piece within the framework of my data mentorship at SharpestMinds: a comprehensive analytical report delivered via Jupyter Book on the activities of Lyftâ€™s bike-share service, Bay Wheels, in the city of San Francisco from 2019 to 2021. This project showcases my mastery of the ETL process as I deconstruct the data dimensionalities of a large dataset analyzing temporal, spatial, consumer, and revenue trends.
