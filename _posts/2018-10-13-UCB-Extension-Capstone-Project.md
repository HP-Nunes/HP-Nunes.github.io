My cohort's final capstone project from my 2018 experience at the UC Berkeley Extension's Data Analytics program. Honestly a bit of a mess in which I pretty much had to figure out--on my own--how to build and interpret predictive Machine Learning models (I settled with a logistic regression and KNN model). The results were...a lesson in the pitfalls of ML engineering, but I did learn a lot!
